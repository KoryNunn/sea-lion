Simple node http router

# Why

I have been using [beeline](https://github.com/xavi-/beeline) heavily for some time.
I like how it works, but have always wanted to change how it was written and tested and be able to implement changes quickly.

Ceeline will also be more modular to make maintenance easier.


# Status

Work in progress...
